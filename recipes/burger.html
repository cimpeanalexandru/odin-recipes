    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until
      well blended.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</p>

      Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per
      side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
