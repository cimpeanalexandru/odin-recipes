    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>
      Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion
      and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add crushed
      tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
      Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season with salt and
      pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring
      occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Keep warm until
      needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>
      While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
      boil. Add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm
      to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>
      At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F
      (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4:</h3>
    <p>
      Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine flour, 1/2
      teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in the first bowl.
      Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl. Combine bread crumbs,
      Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder,
      and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the third bowl.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5:</h3>
    <p>
      Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a meat
      mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Dredge a chicken breast in flour
      mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread
      crumb mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread remaining chicken.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6:</h3>
    <p>
      Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over medium-high
      heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Add breaded chicken in batches;
      cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the
      prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over chicken.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7:</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until chicken reaches an internal temperature
      of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the cheeses have melted, about 5
      minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 8:</h3>
    <p>
      Plate pasta portions. Stir basil into sauce and ladle over pasta. Top each
      portion with chicken.
